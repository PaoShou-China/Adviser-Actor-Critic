## Introduction  
The Adviser-Actor-Critic (AAC) framework addresses high-precision control challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating classical feedback control theory with adaptive RL methodologies. This hybrid architecture demonstrates exceptional performance in robotics applications requiring sub-millimeter positional accuracy and robust goal-conditioned control.  

Key Contributions:  
- **Theoretical Unification**: Bridges classical control principles (e.g., error integration) with deep RL for enhanced trajectory optimization.  
- **Mentored Actor Architecture**: Introduces a parameterized Adviser module that refines actor outputs through adaptive action correction.  
- **Precision Validation**: Achieves ±0.01mm positional accuracy in physical simulations, outperforming conventional RL baselines.  
- **Domain Transfer**: Demonstrates robustness in real-world robotic systems via environment-agnostic policy learning.

## Methodology  

### Control-Theoretic Adviser Design  
The Adviser module implements a parameterized control law inspired by PID controllers, defined by three tunable parameters:  
- **Proportional Gain** $K_p$: Regulates response to instantaneous state errors.  
- **Integral Gain** $K_i$: Accumulates historical errors to eliminate steady-state deviations.  
- **Smoothing Factor** $\sigma$: Modulates action update smoothness to suppress oscillations.  

This formulation operates within the Gymnasium-Robotics environment framework, enabling compatibility with robotic manipulation tasks requiring high-dimensional state observations and goal-conditioned policies.

## Implementation  

### Training Protocol  
The agent is trained via the `train_agent` function in `main.py`. Critical hyperparameters include:  
- `epochs`: Total training iterations.  
- `batch_size`: Batch dimension for gradient updates.  
- `learn_start_size`: Minimum buffer size before policy optimization begins.  

Adviser behavior is decoupled between training and evaluation phases:  
```python
adviser_train = create_adviser(env.desired_goal_dim, env.sim.dt, args.adviser_train_params)
adviser_eval = create_adviser(env.desired_goal_dim, env.sim.dt, args.adviser_eval_params)
```

### Adviser Interface  
```python
def create_adviser(dim, dt, params):
    """
    Constructs control-theoretic adviser with parameters:
    - dim: Error vector dimensionality (env.desired_goal_dim)
    - dt: Sampling interval (env.sim.dt)
    - params: Tuple containing (K_p, K_i, σ)
    """
```

## Experimental Framework  

### Benchmarking Protocol  
All experiments are conducted on the Gymnasium-Robotics environment suite, focusing on high-dimensional robotic manipulation tasks (e.g., FetchReach, HandManipulate). Evaluation metrics include:  
1. **Positional Accuracy**: Measured via Euclidean distance between achieved and desired goals.  
2. **Policy Robustness**: Tested under domain shifts (sim-to-real transfer).  
3. **Training Stability**: Quantified through reward variance and convergence rates.  

### Baseline Comparison  
AAC's performance is benchmarked against the Metric-Residual Network (Cranial-XIX, 2022), a state-of-the-art RL architecture for precision control. Key differences include:  
| Feature                | AAC Framework               | Metric-Residual Network      |  
|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|  
| Control Integration    | Explicit parameterized Adviser | Implicit residual learning    |  
| Action Refinement      | Hierarchical (Actor + Adviser) | Single-stage residual correction |  
| Domain Adaptability    | Domain-agnostic parameters  | Environment-specific tuning   |
